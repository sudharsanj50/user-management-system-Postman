User Management System
This project implements a User Management System using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and a MySQL database for managing user data. The system supports basic user operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities, allowing users to be created, retrieved, updated, and deleted efficiently. The API has been thoroughly tested using Postman to ensure seamless interaction and validation.

Key features include:

Spring Boot for the backend framework, providing a robust and scalable environment.
Hibernate ORM for easy database interaction and object-relational mapping.
MySQL as the database for persistent storage, ensuring secure and reliable data management.
RESTful APIs for managing users with endpoints for CRUD operations.
Fully Tested and validated using Postman to ensure correctness and smooth API functionality.
JWT-based Authentication for secure access and user management.
Detailed error handling and response status codes for better user experience.
The system is designed to be flexible, scalable, and secure, making it ideal for any application that requires user management capabilities. Feel free to clone or fork the repository, follow the setup instructions, and start building on top of this foundation.
